An interactive visualization toolkit for 3D geometric modeling and data visualization using Python.

This project presents a Python-based 3D visualization tool for representing atomic configurations within a crystal lattice using unit cells. Designed with computational material science in mind, the tool provides an extensible way to inspect which unit cells in a lattice contain atoms, leveraging matplotlib's 3D plotting capabilities.
